      "description": "I have built NLP models that read a teacher\u2019s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year\u2019s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more.",

Congenital heart disease varies greatly between patients, so being able to visualize a patient\u2019s unique anatomy and approximate their hemodynamics can be valuable for the planning of surgical repairs. This project explores the use of a 3D-0D coupled model to accomplish this, looking at the process of making a patient-specific 3D model of the heart, as well as how to tune a 0D model to fit patient hemodynamic data. The aim is to continue working on this project, so that the pipeline becomes more streamlined and efficient. Then we hope to edit these models and simulate surgical results to further aid in planning and treatment.",

      "description": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians \u2013 essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets.",

      "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet-wide distributed database with a hierarchical namespace. One consequence of the hierarchical namespace is that various parties involved in the authoritative side of DNS resolution must implicitly or explicitly trust one another. Additionally, DNS allows for explicit trust between different domain names, allowing delegation of nameservice to a nameserver under a different domain. This trust when violated results in major security issues. As such, the trust graph for a domain (all of the other domains explicitly and implicitly trusted by it) represents its potential attack surface; a compromise of any domain in the trust graph leads to the compromise of the target domain. In this project, we build a tool to efficiently build these DNS trust closures and tools to visualize them. We study the trust closures for .gov zones and identify any vulnerabilities in the trust closures that present an avenue for hijacking resolution.",

Specifically for assistive robots, smart homes, or healthcare applications, understanding activities of daily living (ADLs) is an integral component. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions. We propose a new dataset and benchmark called InteractAD for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Our multi-modal (11 modalities) and multi-view (ego and multiple third-person views) dataset is annotated with human-human interactions, beyond human-object relationships considered by the prior work, as well as hierarchical activity labels for each individual in the scene.",

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers simplicity and robustness, while Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) yields state-of-the-art results but suffers from instability and reward hacking. We propose Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), a method combining the best of both approaches. SuperHF focuses on the reward model's importance in RLHF for data efficiency and generalization while replacing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a simpler supervised loss and a KL divergence prior.\n\nWe split our evaluation criteria into robust optimization of the reward while also avoiding reward hacking. For the former, SuperHF beats other training methods on the reward objective. For the latter, we conduct qualitative ratings by GPT-4 to find SuperHF outperforms RLHF in terms of reward, stability, robustness across hyperparameters, and reducing reward hacking.",

We explore using active learning to address this need, adapting modern active learning approaches to the structure of remote sensing data. First, we improve upon \"cold-start\" active learning, which assumes no initial label pool, by using SatMAE, a self-supervised vision transformer, with ProbCover, a state-of-the-art active learning algorithm. Next, we improve on \"warm-start\" active learning approaches, which require an initial label pool, by incorporating geographical information with the margin and entropy sampling techniques. For each domain, we achieve strong performance, demonstrating the use case of geospatial information with self-supervised active learning approaches for remote sensing tasks.",

      "description": "I'm passionate about building design, biophilic design, and discovering how humans can create better structures that exist in harmony with nature and contribute to the health of the surrounding environment while also promoting human wellbeing. As a CS major, I was also interested in developing practical CS skills that I hadn't explored yet, such as Google Cloud and Firebase, and further developing my existing skills, such as implementing APIs.\n\nConsequently, when I discovered the Hybrid Physical and Digital Spaces Lab (HDPS), their amazing work, and their need for developers to assist them in creating the technological infrastructure to prepare for their upcoming research study, I knew this would be a perfect fit. My independent research with HPDS gave me the opportunity to pursue my computer science and academic learning goals while learning more from the interdisciplinary HPDS Lab doing work I'm passionate about to improve the built environment.\n\nThe Hybrid Physical and Digital Spaces Lab (HDPS) is an interdisciplinary team collaborating to create new knowledge about how to build an environment for enhanced environmental sustainability and occupant wellbeing. The goal of the research lab is to collect insights and create references and tools for those involved with constructing the built environment so they can incorporate digital and physical adaptations that would enhance the environments they are creating. HPDS is conducting a research study soon and wants to automate the retrieval and analysis of fitbit data from study participants and indoor air quality environmental sensor data.\n\nInitially, my research mentors gave me the task of writing Cloud Functions to automate the data collection and some analysis processes from the fitbit and AWAIR environmental sensor APIs and ensure all this data was uploaded to the Firebase backend so they could analyze it for the research study or potentially use it to make the accompanying iOS app used in the research study \"smarter\". As I began learning more about Cloud Functions and the task at hand, I realized there were two prerequisite steps that needed to be taken: creating a script to onboard study participant's fitbit API access tokens to Firebase after they agreed to online consent form granting us access to their fitbit data, and a thoughtful Firebase structure design must be prepared so that there is an organized data hierarchy to begin appending data to.\n\nThis Spring, I created the technical infrastructure crucial to the successful implementation of the research study. This involved:\n        \nPart 1\ncreating a script to automatically upload required information from each user to the backend at the beginning of the study\n        \nPart 2\nrestructuring and organizing the existing Firebase\n        \nPart 3\nusing APIs and Google Cloud Functions to automate processes to retrieve fitbit data from study participants and environmental sensor data\ncreating automated data analysis algorithms to extract insights from this data\nstoring the output of the algorithms and the raw data collected in the Firebase backend.",
