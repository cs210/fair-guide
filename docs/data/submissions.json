      "description": "The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms has been on the rise across the machine learning community. SSL helps models acquire useful information from unlabelled data and then use this information to perform downstream tasks. The common paradigm here is to \u2018pretrain\u2019 on a large general dataset and then \u2018finetune\u2019 on a more specialized, typically smaller dataset.\nThe Domain-Agnostic Benchmark for Self-Supervised Learning (DABS) was published in NeurIPS last year, and has served as a benchmark for self-supervised learning algorithms. Specifically, to perform well on DABS, an algorithm must be pretrained on six unlabeled datasets from different domains: natural images, text, speech recordings, medical imaging, multichannel sensor data and image-text pairs.\n(Tamkin et al.)\nThrough this Senior Project, I implemented a system for fast and large scale training of self-supervised learning algorithms with DABS. Specifically, I designed and wrote a JAX codebase for DABS \u2014 enabling us to run baseline algorithms on Google Cloud Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, and have an order of magnitude faster training times.",

      "description": "In many industry computer vision tasks, large, labeled datasets are hard to come by. Therefore, when it comes to training deep neural networks, they have a hard time learning meaningful representations from the dataset. One way to visualize these models is through calculation of \"attention maps\" that display which parts of the input were important in making the associated prediction. Attention maps can be calculated in different ways, and as a result, do not always agree with each other. This problem becomes exacerbated when the model is overfitting to a small dataset. As a result, the QIAI lab proposes an unsupervised learning objective to be used as a fine-tuning step, where we calculate attention maps with 2 different algorithms and enforce a similarity metric between them.",

Our product was inspired by DAHA requests in dorm chats, as well as the need for seniors to sell their belongings before graduating to underclassmen that wish to purchase common goods for their college experience at a cheaper price. We envision this as a marketplace for all Stanford students, which extends the reach of DAHA requests beyond a single dorm. In this marketplace, users can enter items that they are seeking (a DAHA request). All users will have access to the requests, allowing them to see which items are in demand. If they have something being requested and wish to sell it, they can create a DAWA post about their item and name their price. Even if a user doesn't wish to make a DAHA, they can enter the marketplace and see what items are up for sale. By understanding what items are in demand and being requested, we hope to encourage the recycling of goods at Stanford.",
