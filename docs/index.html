                                          I have built NLP models that read a teacher’s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year’s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more.

                                          This project begins the development of a pipeline from medical image data to patient-specific cardiac simulation. Congenital heart disease varies greatly between patients, so being able to visualize a patient’s unique anatomy and approximate their hemodynamics can be valuable for the planning of surgical repairs. This project explores the use of a 3D-0D coupled model to accomplish this, looking at the process of making a patient-specific 3D model of the heart, as well as how to tune a 0D model to fit patient hemodynamic data. The aim is to continue working on this project, so that the pipeline becomes more streamlined and efficient. Then we hope to edit these models and simulate surgical results to further aid in planning and treatment.

                                          Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians – essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets.

                                          Hop is a new transport and remote access protocol with an emphasis on simplicity and security. It aims to be a replacement for SSH with secure identity forwarding and IP roaming while having a significantly smaller code base. The Hop transport layer is uses a Cyclist duplex construction with a Noise handshake pattern to establish a secure connection between endpoints.

                                          The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet-wide distributed database with a hierarchical namespace. One consequence of the hierarchical namespace is that various parties involved in the authoritative side of DNS resolution must implicitly or explicitly trust one another. Additionally, DNS allows for explicit trust between different domain names, allowing delegation of nameservice to a nameserver under a different domain. This trust when violated results in major security issues. As such, the trust graph for a domain (all of the other domains explicitly and implicitly trusted by it) represents its potential attack surface; a compromise of any domain in the trust graph leads to the compromise of the target domain. In this project, we build a tool to efficiently build these DNS trust closures and tools to visualize them. We study the trust closures for .gov zones and identify any vulnerabilities in the trust closures that present an avenue for hijacking resolution.

Every year, countless companies shift their business models from single time pay to recurring payment services which forces users to make tough decisions on which services to use, for how long, and for what price.
                      
                      We, the StreamLine team, have created a platform which takes in a user's desired viewing content and recommends the optimal combination of streaming packages to purchase which get the most out of your subscriptions. Our optimizations will be based on user specified budgets, optional must-have subscriptions, as well as user inputted viewing preferences which can range from specific shows and/or movies to a broader genre of interest. We will then report their varying options which provide them the most relatable content in a budget friendly manner.

                                          Digital communication has solidified into three forms: instant messaging, e-mail, and social media. What if we go beyond these three styles of communication? Our objective is to create a new paradigm to expand the ways we connect with each other online. Coexist is a web messaging application wherein messages are aggregated and sent at a scheduled time in order to reduce digital anxiety and encourage slower, deeper and more detailed conversations.

                                          Splitting the bill can be confusing and time-consuming, but SplitIt can relieve all of that stress. SplitIt is an app that can take a picture of the receipt and recognize all of the different items, including tax and tip. You can then assign different items to different people to split the bill and it can keep a history log of all previous receipts and transactions you split with others. It will automatically tally up how much others owe you and how much you owe your friends, making the entire process fair and efficient!

Submissions are immediately viewable by all users to be voted or commented on, and creators can gain points based on how well their submissions fare, creating a fun community based on hilarious visual gags.

                                          Millions of people interact with a keyboard everyday. However, if you go out and buy an expensive new (likely mechanical) keyboard, you will find that not only can you NOT add additional key-layers, but you can actually only really customize a few keys (4-6 usually). Our goal is for an 'average' user to be able to setup new key-map layers on the keyboard with our GUI tool, and have it flashed to the keyboard from the GUI as well.

                                          Your Edventure begins now. Imagine a future in which you could instantly teleport from your dorm room in California to the sandstone steps of the ancient temple of Petra in Jordan. After exploring the dusty cavernous rooms of the building carved into the stone as early as 5th century BCE, you decide to teleport again: this time to the ancient city of Bagan in Myanmar. Creating this future was the driving vision of the Global Historical Archive (GHA) team at Meta, through the use of virtual reality. However, this future is limited to the few who have access to VR technology. Our project at Edventure hopes to help make this future more accessible to all through making a companion web experience to GHA's VR experience, trying to capture the  majesty and social experience of exploring these wonders with fellow explorers.

                                          In the $150B revenue cycle management space where providers aim to maximize their revenue from treatment provided, medical coding has been especially tedious. The process involves manually translating patient health information & medical procedures into universal codes for billing and record-keeping purposes, and is troubled by 89% error rates, costing providers $17-29B yearly. The problem is also getting worse -- we have an aging global population, a change in standard from ICD-9 to 10 that increases complexity, and 30% coder labor shortages. Moreover, patients often bear the brunt of these coding errors, leading to surprise bills and a lack of trust. 
                      
                      We are Rema, an automated medical coding platform that uses Azure's HIPAA-compliant GPT-4 endpoint and integrates with existing electronic health record systems to handle ICD-10 coding. We’re positioned to provide a timely, efficient, and cost-effective solution, transforming revenue cycle management and improving patient care.

                                          The BenzBeyond team embarked on an ambitious journey to create a breakthrough AR Navigation application. The project's goal was to redefine navigation experiences through the lens of Augmented Reality technology, creating a more interactive and engaging environment for users. Rooted in the principles of user-centered design, we brainstormed, researched, and iterated on our designs, ensuring that our app genuinely addressed real-world user needs. We faced several challenges, including GPS accuracy issues and the intricate complexities of integrating different software platforms. But we overcame these hurdles, turning our envisioned concept into a tangible reality. Our end product is a user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient AR Navigation app, capable of guiding users from point A to point B with minimal distractions. As we reflect on our journey, we are excited about the insights gained, the skills honed, and the future possibilities in the realm of AR navigation.

                                          MetaDrive, composed of Stanford students Rachel Clinton, Anais Marroquin, Mike Yang, and Eric Zhang, has partnered with BMW to reimagine the digital conferencing experience for drivers and passengers of vehicles. We utilize NReal AR glasses to enable users to participate in a safe and immersive digital meeting experience while on the road.
                      
                      Our meeting platform, which is designed in Unity, contains the following features: joining a virtual meeting, sharing screen, taking meeting notes using typing or voice recording, button clicking with hand gestures, and switching modes between the driver mode (a version with restricted functionality) and the passenger mode (the full version). 
                      
                      We are excited to share our work with you!

                                          SOAR is an augmented reality (AR) navigation and social annotation app designed specifically for drivers. With its AR overlays, the app provides a hands-free navigation experience, allowing drivers to follow directions effortlessly while staying focused on the road. Additionally, SOAR enables users to explore and save points of interest (POIs) suggested by their friends, enhancing the social aspect of driving. Users can also contribute their own POIs, fostering a collaborative driving experience. Our prototypes have been developed on platforms such as Oculus in virtual reality (VR), NReal AR glasses, and Android for object detection. The primary goal of SOAR is to enhance driver comfort, entertainment, and safety, while promoting a connected driving community.

                                          Slingshot is a collaborative workflow management platform that leverages existing datasets to make a company's knowledge base accessible to all teams with granular control.
                      
                      We are building a platform to allow researchers, engineers, analysts, and managers at all levels of an organisation to have their questions answered faster, using LLMs to tie these answers to their source-of-truth documents, and building their workflows right into our platform to create the rails for a company's collaborative efforts that are focused on innovating based on these documents.
                      
                      We seek to produce exponential knowledge for our partners as the insights they generate using Slingshot will be accrued in the source-of-truth for future teams to benefit from and integrate into their workflows in our platform.

                                          Recognizing human activities has recently been a central focus in video understanding for different applications. Specifically for assistive robots, smart homes, or healthcare applications, understanding activities of daily living (ADLs) is an integral component. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions. We propose a new dataset and benchmark called InteractAD for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Our multi-modal (11 modalities) and multi-view (ego and multiple third-person views) dataset is annotated with human-human interactions, beyond human-object relationships considered by the prior work, as well as hierarchical activity labels for each individual in the scene.

                                          Ensuring safety and human value alignment in foundation models (FMs) is increasingly important. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers simplicity and robustness, while Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) yields state-of-the-art results but suffers from instability and reward hacking. We propose Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), a method combining the best of both approaches. SuperHF focuses on the reward model's importance in RLHF for data efficiency and generalization while replacing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a simpler supervised loss and a KL divergence prior.
                      
                      We split our evaluation criteria into robust optimization of the reward while also avoiding reward hacking. For the former, SuperHF beats other training methods on the reward objective. For the latter, we conduct qualitative ratings by GPT-4 to find SuperHF outperforms RLHF in terms of reward, stability, robustness across hyperparameters, and reducing reward hacking.

                                          Despite the wide availability of remote sensing imagery, deep learning continues to be bottle-necked in this space by the lack labeled data. We explore using active learning to address this need, adapting modern active learning approaches to the structure of remote sensing data. First, we improve upon ”cold-start” active learning, which assumes no initial label pool, by using SatMAE, a self-supervised vision transformer, with ProbCover, a state-of-the-art active learning algorithm. Next, we improve on ”warm-start” active learning approaches, which require an initial label pool, by incorporating geographical information with the margin and entropy sampling techniques. We showcase strong results for each domain, demonstrating the use case of active learning in this space.

Our game supports up to four players and consists of three rounds. During each round, you will plot everyone (including yourself!) on a cartesian plane using a variety of wacky prompts to guide your placements. You can feel free to answer honestly as there are no winners or losers in this game, only data! Once all players’ placements are collected, you will get to see each player’s average placement, as well as where everyone individually placed them. After the three rounds, special titles are awarded based on each player's results and how their responses compare to the others’!

                                          Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians – essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets.

                                          In the $150B revenue cycle management space where providers aim to maximize their revenue from treatment provided, medical coding has been especially tedious. The process involves manually translating patient health information & medical procedures into universal codes for billing and record-keeping purposes, and is troubled by 89% error rates, costing providers $17-29B yearly. The problem is also getting worse -- we have an aging global population, a change in standard from ICD-9 to 10 that increases complexity, and 30% coder labor shortages. Moreover, patients often bear the brunt of these coding errors, leading to surprise bills and a lack of trust. 
                      
                      We are Rema, an automated medical coding platform that uses Azure's HIPAA-compliant GPT-4 endpoint and integrates with existing electronic health record systems to handle ICD-10 coding. We’re positioned to provide a timely, efficient, and cost-effective solution, transforming revenue cycle management and improving patient care.

                                          Slingshot is a collaborative workflow management platform that leverages existing datasets to make a company's knowledge base accessible to all teams with granular control.
                      
                      We are building a platform to allow researchers, engineers, analysts, and managers at all levels of an organisation to have their questions answered faster, using LLMs to tie these answers to their source-of-truth documents, and building their workflows right into our platform to create the rails for a company's collaborative efforts that are focused on innovating based on these documents.
                      
                      We seek to produce exponential knowledge for our partners as the insights they generate using Slingshot will be accrued in the source-of-truth for future teams to benefit from and integrate into their workflows in our platform.

                                          Recognizing human activities has recently been a central focus in video understanding for different applications. Specifically for assistive robots, smart homes, or healthcare applications, understanding activities of daily living (ADLs) is an integral component. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions. We propose a new dataset and benchmark called InteractAD for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Our multi-modal (11 modalities) and multi-view (ego and multiple third-person views) dataset is annotated with human-human interactions, beyond human-object relationships considered by the prior work, as well as hierarchical activity labels for each individual in the scene.

                                          Ensuring safety and human value alignment in foundation models (FMs) is increasingly important. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers simplicity and robustness, while Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) yields state-of-the-art results but suffers from instability and reward hacking. We propose Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), a method combining the best of both approaches. SuperHF focuses on the reward model's importance in RLHF for data efficiency and generalization while replacing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a simpler supervised loss and a KL divergence prior.
                      
                      We split our evaluation criteria into robust optimization of the reward while also avoiding reward hacking. For the former, SuperHF beats other training methods on the reward objective. For the latter, we conduct qualitative ratings by GPT-4 to find SuperHF outperforms RLHF in terms of reward, stability, robustness across hyperparameters, and reducing reward hacking.

                                          Despite the wide availability of remote sensing imagery, deep learning continues to be bottle-necked in this space by the lack labeled data. We explore using active learning to address this need, adapting modern active learning approaches to the structure of remote sensing data. First, we improve upon ”cold-start” active learning, which assumes no initial label pool, by using SatMAE, a self-supervised vision transformer, with ProbCover, a state-of-the-art active learning algorithm. Next, we improve on ”warm-start” active learning approaches, which require an initial label pool, by incorporating geographical information with the margin and entropy sampling techniques. We showcase strong results for each domain, demonstrating the use case of active learning in this space.

                                          Recognizing human activities has recently been a central focus in video understanding for different applications. Specifically for assistive robots, smart homes, or healthcare applications, understanding activities of daily living (ADLs) is an integral component. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions. We propose a new dataset and benchmark called InteractAD for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Our multi-modal (11 modalities) and multi-view (ego and multiple third-person views) dataset is annotated with human-human interactions, beyond human-object relationships considered by the prior work, as well as hierarchical activity labels for each individual in the scene.

                                          Ensuring safety and human value alignment in foundation models (FMs) is increasingly important. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers simplicity and robustness, while Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) yields state-of-the-art results but suffers from instability and reward hacking. We propose Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), a method combining the best of both approaches. SuperHF focuses on the reward model's importance in RLHF for data efficiency and generalization while replacing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a simpler supervised loss and a KL divergence prior.
                      
                      We split our evaluation criteria into robust optimization of the reward while also avoiding reward hacking. For the former, SuperHF beats other training methods on the reward objective. For the latter, we conduct qualitative ratings by GPT-4 to find SuperHF outperforms RLHF in terms of reward, stability, robustness across hyperparameters, and reducing reward hacking.

                                          Despite the wide availability of remote sensing imagery, deep learning continues to be bottle-necked in this space by the lack labeled data. We explore using active learning to address this need, adapting modern active learning approaches to the structure of remote sensing data. First, we improve upon ”cold-start” active learning, which assumes no initial label pool, by using SatMAE, a self-supervised vision transformer, with ProbCover, a state-of-the-art active learning algorithm. Next, we improve on ”warm-start” active learning approaches, which require an initial label pool, by incorporating geographical information with the margin and entropy sampling techniques. We showcase strong results for each domain, demonstrating the use case of active learning in this space.

                                          The BenzBeyond team embarked on an ambitious journey to create a breakthrough AR Navigation application. The project's goal was to redefine navigation experiences through the lens of Augmented Reality technology, creating a more interactive and engaging environment for users. Rooted in the principles of user-centered design, we brainstormed, researched, and iterated on our designs, ensuring that our app genuinely addressed real-world user needs. We faced several challenges, including GPS accuracy issues and the intricate complexities of integrating different software platforms. But we overcame these hurdles, turning our envisioned concept into a tangible reality. Our end product is a user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient AR Navigation app, capable of guiding users from point A to point B with minimal distractions. As we reflect on our journey, we are excited about the insights gained, the skills honed, and the future possibilities in the realm of AR navigation.

                                          The BenzBeyond team embarked on an ambitious journey to create a breakthrough AR Navigation application. The project's goal was to redefine navigation experiences through the lens of Augmented Reality technology, creating a more interactive and engaging environment for users. Rooted in the principles of user-centered design, we brainstormed, researched, and iterated on our designs, ensuring that our app genuinely addressed real-world user needs. We faced several challenges, including GPS accuracy issues and the intricate complexities of integrating different software platforms. But we overcame these hurdles, turning our envisioned concept into a tangible reality. Our end product is a user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient AR Navigation app, capable of guiding users from point A to point B with minimal distractions. As we reflect on our journey, we are excited about the insights gained, the skills honed, and the future possibilities in the realm of AR navigation.

                                          Our project is a web application which is oriented toward the optimization of subscription services based on a user's interests and budget. Every year, countless companies shift their business models from single time pay to recurring payment services which forces users to make tough decisions on which services to use, for how long, and for what price.
                      
                      We, the StreamLine team, have created a platform which takes in a user's desired viewing content and recommends the optimal combination of streaming packages to purchase which get the most out of your subscriptions. Our optimizations will be based on user specified budgets, optional must-have subscriptions, as well as user inputted viewing preferences which can range from specific shows and/or movies to a broader genre of interest. We will then report their varying options which provide them the most relatable content in a budget friendly manner.

Coexist is a web messaging application wherein messages are aggregated and sent at a scheduled time in order to reduce digital anxiety and encourage slower, deeper and more detailed conversations.

                      We are building a platform to allow researchers, engineers, analysts, and managers at all levels of an organisation to have their questions answered faster, using LLMs to tie these answers to their source-of-truth documents, and building their workflows right into our platform to create the rails for a company's collaborative efforts that are focused on innovating based on these documents.

Gathering clothing from a variety of sources, we hope to create a website in which users can search with many filtering options for clothing themes, brands, or styles and be able to see the clothing that fits those parameters and links to purchase the clothing. The search engine is powered by a computer vision model to provide enhanced search results and semantic parsing!

                                          I have built NLP models that read a teacher’s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year’s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more.

                                          Your Edventure begins now. Imagine a future in which you could instantly teleport from your dorm room in California to the sandstone steps of the ancient temple of Petra in Jordan. After exploring the dusty cavernous rooms of the building carved into the stone as early as 5th century BCE, you decide to teleport again: this time to the ancient city of Bagan in Myanmar. Creating this future was the driving vision of the Global Historical Archive (GHA) team at Meta, through the use of virtual reality. However, this future is limited to the few who have access to VR technology. Our project at Edventure hopes to help make this future more accessible to all through making a companion web experience to GHA's VR experience, trying to capture the  majesty and social experience of exploring these wonders with fellow explorers.

                                          Our project is a web application which is oriented toward the optimization of subscription services based on a user's interests and budget. Every year, countless companies shift their business models from single time pay to recurring payment services which forces users to make tough decisions on which services to use, for how long, and for what price.
                      
                      We, the StreamLine team, have created a platform which takes in a user's desired viewing content and recommends the optimal combination of streaming packages to purchase which get the most out of your subscriptions. Our optimizations will be based on user specified budgets, optional must-have subscriptions, as well as user inputted viewing preferences which can range from specific shows and/or movies to a broader genre of interest. We will then report their varying options which provide them the most relatable content in a budget friendly manner.

                                          Splitting the bill can be confusing and time-consuming, but SplitIt can relieve all of that stress. SplitIt is an app that can take a picture of the receipt and recognize all of the different items, including tax and tip. You can then assign different items to different people to split the bill and it can keep a history log of all previous receipts and transactions you split with others. It will automatically tally up how much others owe you and how much you owe your friends, making the entire process fair and efficient!

                                          Photo Wars is a web platform for user-submitted and user-voted photo humor, inspired by the popular subreddit r/photoshopbattles. Photo Wars provides a centralized and streamlined interface for interacting with, sharing, and supporting photo comedy by allowing users to create and compete in a “photo war”, a low-stakes competition that has one user submitting an image for others to caption and submit photoshopped versions of the original. Submissions are immediately viewable by all users to be voted or commented on, and creators can gain points based on how well their submissions fare, creating a fun community based on hilarious visual gags.

                                          A Plot in the Dark is an online party game that tests how well you know your friends—and how well your friends know you! Our game supports up to four players and consists of three rounds. During each round, you will plot everyone (including yourself!) on a cartesian plane using a variety of wacky prompts to guide your placements. You can feel free to answer honestly as there are no winners or losers in this game, only data! Once all players’ placements are collected, you will get to see each player’s average placement, as well as where everyone individually placed them. After the three rounds, special titles are awarded based on each player's results and how their responses compare to the others’!

                                          This project begins the development of a pipeline from medical image data to patient-specific cardiac simulation. Congenital heart disease varies greatly between patients, so being able to visualize a patient’s unique anatomy and approximate their hemodynamics can be valuable for the planning of surgical repairs. This project explores the use of a 3D-0D coupled model to accomplish this, looking at the process of making a patient-specific 3D model of the heart, as well as how to tune a 0D model to fit patient hemodynamic data. The aim is to continue working on this project, so that the pipeline becomes more streamlined and efficient. Then we hope to edit these models and simulate surgical results to further aid in planning and treatment.

                                          Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians – essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets.

                                          In the $150B revenue cycle management space where providers aim to maximize their revenue from treatment provided, medical coding has been especially tedious. The process involves manually translating patient health information & medical procedures into universal codes for billing and record-keeping purposes, and is troubled by 89% error rates, costing providers $17-29B yearly. The problem is also getting worse -- we have an aging global population, a change in standard from ICD-9 to 10 that increases complexity, and 30% coder labor shortages. Moreover, patients often bear the brunt of these coding errors, leading to surprise bills and a lack of trust.

                                          Millions of people interact with a keyboard everyday. However, if you go out and buy an expensive new (likely mechanical) keyboard, you will find that not only can you NOT add additional key-layers, but you can actually only really customize a few keys (4-6 usually). Our goal is for an 'average' user to be able to setup new key-map layers on the keyboard with our GUI tool, and have it flashed to the keyboard from the GUI as well.

There are other online tools that generate recipes from the ingredients you have, but they still make you manually check off everything in your fridge, which becomes a huge hassle.

                                          Millions of people interact with a keyboard everyday. However, if you go out and buy an expensive new (likely mechanical) keyboard, you will find that not only can you NOT add additional key-layers, but you can actually only really customize a few keys (4-6 usually). Our goal is for an 'average' user to be able to setup new key-map layers on the keyboard with our GUI tool, and have it flashed to the keyboard from the GUI as well.

                                          Slingshot is a collaborative workflow management platform that leverages existing datasets to make a company's knowledge base accessible to all teams with granular control.
                      
                      We are building a platform to allow researchers, engineers, analysts, and managers at all levels of an organisation to have their questions answered faster, using LLMs to tie these answers to their source-of-truth documents, and building their workflows right into our platform to create the rails for a company's collaborative efforts that are focused on innovating based on these documents.
                      
                      We seek to produce exponential knowledge for our partners as the insights they generate using Slingshot will be accrued in the source-of-truth for future teams to benefit from and integrate into their workflows in our platform.

                                          Hop is a new transport and remote access protocol with an emphasis on simplicity and security. It aims to be a replacement for SSH with secure identity forwarding and IP roaming while having a significantly smaller code base. The Hop transport layer is uses a Cyclist duplex construction with a Noise handshake pattern to establish a secure connection between endpoints.

                                          The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet-wide distributed database with a hierarchical namespace. One consequence of the hierarchical namespace is that various parties involved in the authoritative side of DNS resolution must implicitly or explicitly trust one another. Additionally, DNS allows for explicit trust between different domain names, allowing delegation of nameservice to a nameserver under a different domain. This trust when violated results in major security issues. As such, the trust graph for a domain (all of the other domains explicitly and implicitly trusted by it) represents its potential attack surface; a compromise of any domain in the trust graph leads to the compromise of the target domain. In this project, we build a tool to efficiently build these DNS trust closures and tools to visualize them. We study the trust closures for .gov zones and identify any vulnerabilities in the trust closures that present an avenue for hijacking resolution.

                                          I have built NLP models that read a teacher’s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year’s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more.

                                          Splitting the bill can be confusing and time-consuming, but SplitIt can relieve all of that stress. SplitIt is an app that can take a picture of the receipt and recognize all of the different items, including tax and tip. You can then assign different items to different people to split the bill and it can keep a history log of all previous receipts and transactions you split with others. It will automatically tally up how much others owe you and how much you owe your friends, making the entire process fair and efficient!

                                          Your Edventure begins now. Imagine a future in which you could instantly teleport from your dorm room in California to the sandstone steps of the ancient temple of Petra in Jordan. After exploring the dusty cavernous rooms of the building carved into the stone as early as 5th century BCE, you decide to teleport again: this time to the ancient city of Bagan in Myanmar. Creating this future was the driving vision of the Global Historical Archive (GHA) team at Meta, through the use of virtual reality. However, this future is limited to the few who have access to VR technology. Our project at Edventure hopes to help make this future more accessible to all through making a companion web experience to GHA's VR experience, trying to capture the  majesty and social experience of exploring these wonders with fellow explorers.

                                          SOAR is an augmented reality (AR) navigation and social annotation app designed specifically for drivers. With its AR overlays, the app provides a hands-free navigation experience, allowing drivers to follow directions effortlessly while staying focused on the road. Additionally, SOAR enables users to explore and save points of interest (POIs) suggested by their friends, enhancing the social aspect of driving. Users can also contribute their own POIs, fostering a collaborative driving experience. Our prototypes have been developed on platforms such as Oculus in virtual reality (VR), NReal AR glasses, and Android for object detection. The primary goal of SOAR is to enhance driver comfort, entertainment, and safety, while promoting a connected driving community.

                                          Digital communication has solidified into three forms: instant messaging, e-mail, and social media. What if we go beyond these three styles of communication? Our objective is to create a new paradigm to expand the ways we connect with each other online. Coexist is a web messaging application wherein messages are aggregated and sent at a scheduled time in order to reduce digital anxiety and encourage slower, deeper and more detailed conversations.

Photo Wars provides a centralized and streamlined interface for interacting with, sharing, and supporting photo comedy by allowing users to create and compete in a “photo war”, a low-stakes competition that has one user submitting an image for others to caption and submit photoshopped versions of the original. Submissions are immediately viewable by all users to be voted or commented on, and creators can gain points based on how well their submissions fare, creating a fun community based on hilarious visual gags.
