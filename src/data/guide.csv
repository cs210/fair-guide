Karbon,"Vedi Chaudhri, McDavis Ansere, Michael Lin, Trevor Rex, Alwyn Tan","When you get into a car, you can feel a variety of emotions--all of which can impact your driving. Did you know that if you’re in a negative emotional state of mind, you’re ten times as likely to get into a car accident? We were shocked when we discovered this statistic! Hence, we were inspired to build an emotionally intelligent personal assistant for a car, Karbon. Karbon addresses this issue by continuously analyzing the driver's emotional state and responding in a personalized manner to elevate the driver's mood, allowing for a safer and smoother driving experience.",Automotive

Individual,Hannah Leou,"Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a promising future for personalized testing.  CAT seeks to intelligently examine a student by selecting questions from a pre-existing question bank that fit the student's estimated ability level.  The questions and corresponding responses are then used to compute an accurate estimate student ability after the exam is complete.  

This project focuses upon blending Item Response Theory and Reinforcement Learning to create a robust question selector for CAT.  The goal is to create a question selector that strikes a balance between exploration of diverse questions and exploitation of the student's estimated ability level. ",Education

The Giving World,"Austin Jacobs, Kathleen Kenealy, Alfonce Nzioka, Cary Huang","There are an overwhelming number of charities and non-profits, and many address similar issues, so it can be difficult for donors to find and choose where to give, even if a donor has decided on a particular social issue they want to focus on. After donating, the struggle continues as donors often cannot find information about how their donations are being used.
The Giving World is a website that helps people find and review charities, making it easy to select a non-profit to donate money or time to based on giving ability, interests, location and more. Recent news stories, examples of work, and financial information about a non-profit will allow donors to discuss how funds are being allocated and may encourage transparency among non-profits.","Government, News, & Service"

White Mirror,"Aileen Wang, Brandon Cui, Daniel Classon, Nikki Kang, Stephanie Niu","Absentee voting in the U.S. is not easy; evasive deadlines, postage costs, and long wait times make turnout among absentee voters far lower than non-absentee voters. Especially for college students, many of whom live outside their home state, the logistical difficulty of voting absentee poses a barrier to casting votes. White Mirror is an online absentee voting solution that aims to increase voter turnout by making absentee voting accessible and seamless. Built on the Oracle Blockchain platform, White Mirror uses blockchain to secure voter identity and protect voter privacy. Our application is an exploration into a future where distance is no longer a barrier to civic engagement. ","Government, News, & Service"

Alex Zaheer,Alex Zaheer,"In recent Western democratic elections, a common threat has plagued political campaigns: email exfiltration. Adversaries, often foreign nation-state actors, use perimeter-breaching tactics such as spear phishing to compromise the email accounts of high-profile members of political campaigns in the hope of finding and publishing private communications that paint the campaign in a bad light. The most recent form of this attack was that against French President Emmanuel Macron's campaign in 2017. This is also a tactic used against American corporations, a relevant example being the North Korean attack against Sony Pictures in which damaging private communications among Sony executives resulted in high-profile leadership upheaval. This project aims to develop a tool to deter this attack: cyber-blurring. This tool plans to use Natural Language Generation to create emails that plausibly look real to an attacker that has breached and organization's email database.","Government, News, & Service"

Luna,"Maggie Davis, Stephanie Campa, Caterina Wu, Anna Verwillow","We are Luna, a period app for young women getting their first period. As an all-female engineering team passionate about women’s health and education, we set out to make an app that empowers girls to feel comfortable navigating this new component of their lives. We want to make an equitable product as everyone experiences the process differently. To this end, we created a site that would be applicable to any young woman before and after they've had their first period, who have questions about their periods, who don’t have regular periods, who don't want the overwhelming features relevant to women later in life, and/or who want a safe place to track their periods. We will be filling a niche that does not yet exist as the vast majority of period apps are geared towards older women and extremely focused on fertility. Our goal is to decouple periods from fertility in order to create a welcoming environment for young women. ",Health & Biomedical
