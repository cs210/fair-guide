AI-based decision support tools typically aim to do two things: improve patient outcomes and reduce provider cost and burden. We study real-world production data from a chest x-ray interpretation aid deployed in Vietnam hospitals and analyze cases of AI-clinician disagreement. Inspired by this real-world data, we hypothesize that while AI-clinician collaborative performance could be improved by directly enhancing the underlying model, other aspects of collaboration are ripe for innovation. In particular, when and how to present model output should be motivated by characteristics such as the expected quality of a given prediction and whether the clinician is expected to agree with it along with clinical significance of the pathology in question. We, therefore, present a novel framework for AI-supported diagnosis using these characteristics, which is expected to mitigate risks of misdiagnosis while simultaneously reducing clinician burden.",,,,,,

SSL helps models acquire useful information from unlabelled data and then use this information to perform downstream tasks. The common paradigm here is to ‘pretrain’ on a large general dataset and then ‘finetune’ on a more specialized, typically smaller dataset.
The Domain-Agnostic Benchmark for Self-Supervised Learning (DABS) was published in NeurIPS last year, and has served as a benchmark for self-supervised learning algorithms. Specifically, to perform well on DABS, an algorithm must be pretrained on six unlabeled datasets from different domains: natural images, text, speech recordings, medical imaging, multichannel sensor data and image-text pairs.

Therefore, when it comes to training deep neural networks, they have a hard time learning meaningful representations from the dataset. One way to visualize these models is through calculation of ""attention maps"" that display which parts of the input were important in making the associated prediction. Attention maps can be calculated in different ways, and as a result, do not always agree with each other. This problem becomes exacerbated when the model is overfitting to a small dataset. As a result, the QIAI lab proposes an unsupervised learning objective to be used as a fine-tuning step, where we calculate attention maps with 2 different algorithms and enforce a similarity metric between them.",,,,,,

We extend the recently-introduced DABS benchmark with the addition of five real-world scientific domains: protein biology, bacterial genomics, multispectral satellite imagery, semiconductor wafers, and particle physics, bringing the total number of domains in the benchmark to twelve. We also propose a new universal SSL algorithm, Capri, and a generalized version of masked autoencoding, apply both on all twelve domains---the most wide-ranging exploration of SSL yet. We find that multiple algorithms show gains across all domains, outperforming previous baselines.

However, expert feedback is often assumed to be drawn from an underlying unimodal reward function. This assumption does not always hold, including in settings where multiple experts provide data or when a single expert provides data for different tasks. We thus have to go beyond learning a unimodal reward and focus on learning a multimodal reward function. We formulate the multimodal reward learning as a mixture learning problem and develop a novel ranking-based learning approach, in which the experts are only required to rank a given set of trajectories. Furthermore, as access to interaction data is often expensive in robotics, we develop an active querying approach to accelerate the learning process. We conduct experiments and user studies using a multi-task variant of OpenAI's LunarLander and a real Fetch robot, where we collect data from multiple users with different preferences. The results suggest that our approach can efficiently learn multimodal reward functions, and improve data-efficiency over benchmark methods that we adapt to our learning problem.",,,,,,

The scaleup project aims to demonstrate that the architecture can keep pace with growing neural network sizes while maintaining its low overheads. Ongoing verification of a new chip that will demonstrate scaleup involves emulating the design in hardware to accelerate logic simulations. Emulation will allow the development team to test scaling the system before fabricating the design.,,,,,,

go through job boards with thousands of company names you’ve never heard of
vet each startup’s funding + product + team background
then make sure your profile fits the exact tech stack that the startup is looking for
finally spend hours writing an application that will never get read
all the while you’re working a full-time job at your current company

We've almost entirely automated the job search process to be handled mostly over email, at scale. Given a shortlist of preferences, each user will be given the best matches that exactly match their skills and interests, with an 'easy-to-vet' process. These matches then directly lead to interviews and phone screens!",,,,,,
