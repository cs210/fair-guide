      "description": "I have built NLP models that read a teacher\u2019s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year\u2019s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more.",

Congenital heart disease varies greatly between patients, so being able to visualize a patient\u2019s unique anatomy and approximate their hemodynamics can be valuable for the planning of surgical repairs. This project explores the use of a 3D-0D coupled model to accomplish this, looking at the process of making a patient-specific 3D model of the heart, as well as how to tune a 0D model to fit patient hemodynamic data. The aim is to continue working on this project, so that the pipeline becomes more streamlined and efficient. Then we hope to edit these models and simulate surgical results to further aid in planning and treatment.",

      "description": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians \u2013 essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets.",

      "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet-wide distributed database with a hierarchical namespace. One consequence of the hierarchical namespace is that various parties involved in the authoritative side of DNS resolution must implicitly or explicitly trust one another. Additionally, DNS allows for explicit trust between different domain names, allowing delegation of nameservice to a nameserver under a different domain. This trust when violated results in major security issues. As such, the trust graph for a domain (all of the other domains explicitly and implicitly trusted by it) represents its potential attack surface; a compromise of any domain in the trust graph leads to the compromise of the target domain. In this project, we build a tool to efficiently build these DNS trust closures and tools to visualize them. We study the trust closures for .gov zones and identify any vulnerabilities in the trust closures that present an avenue for hijacking resolution.",

      "description": "In the $150B revenue cycle management space where providers aim to maximize their revenue from treatment provided, medical coding has been especially tedious. The process involves manually translating patient health information & medical procedures into universal codes for billing and record-keeping purposes, and is troubled by 89% error rates, costing providers $17-29B yearly. The problem is also getting worse -- we have an aging global population, a change in standard from ICD-9 to 10 that increases complexity, and 30% coder labor shortages. Moreover, patients often bear the brunt of these coding errors, leading to surprise bills and a lack of trust. \n\nWe are Rema, an automated medical coding platform that uses Azure's HIPAA-compliant GPT-4 endpoint and integrates with existing electronic health record systems to handle ICD-10 coding. We\u2019re positioned to provide a timely, efficient, and cost-effective solution, transforming revenue cycle management and improving patient care.",

      "description": "The BenzBeyond team embarked on an ambitious journey to create a breakthrough AR Navigation application. The project's goal was to redefine navigation experiences through the lens of Augmented Reality technology, creating a more interactive and engaging environment for users. Rooted in the principles of user-centered design, we brainstormed, researched, and iterated on our designs, ensuring that our app genuinely addressed real-world user needs. We faced several challenges, including GPS accuracy issues and the intricate complexities of integrating different software platforms. But we overcame these hurdles, turning our envisioned concept into a tangible reality. Our end product is a user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient AR Navigation app, capable of guiding users from point A to point B with minimal distractions. As we reflect on our journey, we are excited about the insights gained, the skills honed, and the future possibilities in the realm of AR navigation.",
