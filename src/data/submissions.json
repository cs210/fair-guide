Did you know that if you\u2019re in a negative emotional state of mind, you\u2019re ten times as likely to get into a car accident? We were shocked when we discovered this statistic! Hence, we were inspired to build an emotionally intelligent personal assistant for a car, Karbon. Karbon addresses this issue by continuously analyzing the driver's emotional state and responding in a personalized manner to elevate the driver's mood, allowing for a safer and smoother driving experience.",

Adversaries, often foreign nation-state actors, use perimeter-breaching tactics such as spear phishing to compromise the email accounts of high-profile members of political campaigns in the hope of finding and publishing private communications that paint the campaign in a bad light. The most recent form of this attack was that against French President Emmanuel Macron's campaign in 2017. This is also a tactic used against American corporations, a relevant example being the North Korean attack against Sony Pictures in which damaging private communications among Sony executives resulted in high-profile leadership upheaval. This project aims to develop a tool to deter this attack: cyber-blurring.
