      "description": "Sebastian is a tiny scripting language for music theory. It provides powerful features for representing and manipulating music analysis symbols, and can generate common-practice-period harmony. Sebastian is unique: unlike other tools with audio focuses, Sebastian focuses on manipulation of music theory symbols.\n\nSebastian generates MusicXML files as output, which can be rendered into sheet music by many other programs (Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, etc) and libraries (VexFlow, LilyPond, etc).\n\nSebastian is also highly extensible. Although it generates common-practice-period (baroque) harmony by default, the rules are entirely separated from the code, and can be easily overridden or altered. New rules governing the harmonic output can trivially be added, or replace the standard rules entirely.\n\nSebastian can work on its own, or as a js library to power web apps and other microservices.",

This approach can enable detection of malicious code, not by a static analysis of binary files, but by efficiently and transparently analyzing the instructions actually executed on the CPU. It is intended to be robust against obfuscation techniques employed by malware designers, such as encryption of executable code under a device-specific key, as well as VM-detection approaches. The algorithm works by combining frequency and time-series information into a single MinHash-based fingerprint vector which is robust to variability stemming from sampling error and address space layout randomization.",

For each event, the user has to pick an outcome as well as a percentage confidence they have on the outcome, and the confidence is the user's way of placing a varying stake on each event, as they'll be both rewarded and penalized more for indicating 100% confidence as opposed to 1%.
