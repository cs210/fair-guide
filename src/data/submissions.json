AI-based decision support tools typically aim to do two things: improve patient outcomes and reduce provider cost and burden. We study real-world production data from a chest x-ray interpretation aid deployed in Vietnam hospitals and analyze cases of AI-clinician disagreement. Inspired by this real-world data, we hypothesize that while AI-clinician collaborative performance could be improved by directly enhancing the underlying model, other aspects of collaboration are ripe for innovation. In particular, when and how to present model output should be motivated by characteristics such as the expected quality of a given prediction and whether the clinician is expected to agree with it along with clinical significance of the pathology in question. We, therefore, present a novel framework for AI-supported diagnosis using these characteristics, which is expected to mitigate risks of misdiagnosis while simultaneously reducing clinician burden.",

Therefore, when it comes to training deep neural networks, they have a hard time learning meaningful representations from the dataset. One way to visualize these models is through calculation of \"attention maps\" that display which parts of the input were important in making the associated prediction. Attention maps can be calculated in different ways, and as a result, do not always agree with each other. This problem becomes exacerbated when the model is overfitting to a small dataset. As a result, the QIAI lab proposes an unsupervised learning objective to be used as a fine-tuning step, where we calculate attention maps with 2 different algorithms and enforce a similarity metric between them.",

We present DABS 2.0: a set of improved datasets, algorithms, and software systems for advancing research on universal SSL. We extend the recently-introduced DABS benchmark with the addition of five real-world scientific domains: protein biology, bacterial genomics, multispectral satellite imagery, semiconductor wafers, and particle physics, bringing the total number of domains in the benchmark to twelve. We also propose a new universal SSL algorithm, Capri, and a generalized version of masked autoencoding, apply both on all twelve domains---the most wide-ranging exploration of SSL yet. We find that multiple algorithms show gains across all domains, outperforming previous baselines. In addition, we find that the optimal masking fraction varies based on the domain, and linear evaluator performance is not correlated with finetuning accuracy. We also present and open source our codebase, DABS-Launcher, which enables pretraining and transfer runs across all domains in <36 hours using compute resources that are free for academic researchers.",

      "description": "Learning from human feedback has been shown to be a useful approach in acquiring robot reward functions. However, expert feedback is often assumed to be drawn from an underlying unimodal reward function. This assumption does not always hold, including in settings where multiple experts provide data or when a single expert provides data for different tasks. We thus have to go beyond learning a unimodal reward and focus on learning a multimodal reward function. We formulate the multimodal reward learning as a mixture learning problem and develop a novel ranking-based learning approach, in which the experts are only required to rank a given set of trajectories. Furthermore, as access to interaction data is often expensive in robotics, we develop an active querying approach to accelerate the learning process. We conduct experiments and user studies using a multi-task variant of OpenAI's LunarLander and a real Fetch robot, where we collect data from multiple users with different preferences. The results suggest that our approach can efficiently learn multimodal reward functions, and improve data-efficiency over benchmark methods that we adapt to our learning problem.",

The common paradigm here is to \u2018pretrain\u2019 on a large general dataset and then \u2018finetune\u2019 on a more specialized, typically smaller dataset.\nThe Domain-Agnostic Benchmark for Self-Supervised Learning (DABS) was published earlier this year, and has served as a benchmark for self-supervised learning algorithms. Specifically, to perform well on DABS, an algorithm must be pretrained on six unlabeled datasets from different domains: natural images, text, speech recordings, medical imaging, multichannel sensor data and image-text pairs. \nThrough this Senior Project, I implemented a system for fast and large scale training of self-supervised learning algorithms with DABS. Specifically, I designed and wrote a JAX codebase for DABS \u2014 enabling us to run baseline algorithms on Google Cloud Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, and have an order of magnitude faster training times.",
