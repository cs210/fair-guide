We extract socioeconomic indicators from satellite imagery using a transfer learning approach where nighttime light intensities is a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning features useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters identifying terrains and man-made structures without supervision beyond nighttime lights. These features are informative for poverty mapping, approaching the predictive performance of survey data from the field.",

These tools answer a series of questions about dialogues: How does the topic of conversation influence the conversation? Do humans react differently to chatbots than to human conversational partners? Is the human tendency to mirror sentiment still present in human-agent conversations?",

Virtual reality is uniquely immersive, and we’ve leveraged this immersion in order to create an experience with immediacy and emotional resonance. Against the dramatic backdrop of a space mission gone horribly wrong, students are prompted to think critically about the emotional states of others. With the help of teachers, administrators, students, and education experts, we have crafted a powerful new way to teach social and emotional skills that will help students be successful in the classroom and beyond.",
