6/5/2023 10:40:39,Code in Place Teacher Feedback,Ashlee Kupor,CS191,"I have built NLP models that read a teacher’s transcript and highlight five different teaching strategies. We provide Section Leaders in Code in Place with weekly feedback based on these talk moves by pulling their transcript from the zoom API, running it through the models, and then displaying it within an intuitive UI. To develop the models, I explored both Roberta and GPT, using different hyperparameters based on how the talk moves are often employed. Using these models on last year’s Code in Place data, we find that teachers who use more talk moves increase student outcomes, such as having higher section attendance. We are currently running a study on the effect of choice on teacher development, and hypothesize that if teachers choose which of the five talk moves to receive feedback on each week, they will internalize the feedback more."
6/5/2023 13:36:40,Developing a Pipeline for Patient-Specific Models of Congenital Heart Disease,Kaitlin Harold,CS191,"This project begins the development of a pipeline from medical image data to patient-specific cardiac simulation. Congenital heart disease varies greatly between patients, so being able to visualize a patient’s unique anatomy and approximate their hemodynamics can be valuable for the planning of surgical repairs. This project explores the use of a 3D-0D coupled model to accomplish this, looking at the process of making a patient-specific 3D model of the heart, as well as how to tune a 0D model to fit patient hemodynamic data. The aim is to continue working on this project, so that the pipeline becomes more streamlined and efficient. Then we hope to edit these models and simulate surgical results to further aid in planning and treatment."

6/8/2023 15:57:29,cxrlearn,Niveditha Iyer,CS191,"Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a rich source of information for physicians – essential for disease diagnosis and treatment selection. Recent deep learning models aim to alleviate strain on medical resources and improve patient care by automating the detection of diseases from CXRs. However, shortages of labeled CXRs can pose a serious challenge when training models. Currently, models are generally pretrained on ImageNet, but they often need to then be finetuned on hundreds of thousands of labeled CXRs to achieve high performance. Therefore, the current approach to model development is not viable on tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. An emerging method for reducing reliance on large amounts of labeled data is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled CXR datasets to automatically learn features that can be leveraged for downstream interpretation tasks. In this work, we investigated whether self-supervised pretraining methods could outperform traditional ImageNet pretraining for chest X-ray interpretation. We found that SSL-pretrained models outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models on thirteen different datasets representing high diversity in geographies, clinical settings, and prediction tasks. We thus show that SSL on unlabeled CXR data is a promising pretraining approach for a wide variety of CXR interpretation tasks, enabling a shift away from costly labeled datasets."

6/9/2023 3:44:00,DNS Trawler,Rishi Sreekanth,CS191,"The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet-wide distributed database with a hierarchical namespace. One consequence of the hierarchical namespace is that various parties involved in the authoritative side of DNS resolution must implicitly or explicitly trust one another. Additionally, DNS allows for explicit trust between different domain names, allowing delegation of nameservice to a nameserver under a different domain. This trust when violated results in major security issues. As such, the trust graph for a domain (all of the other domains explicitly and implicitly trusted by it) represents its potential attack surface; a compromise of any domain in the trust graph leads to the compromise of the target domain. In this project, we build a tool to efficiently build these DNS trust closures and tools to visualize them. We study the trust closures for .gov zones and identify any vulnerabilities in the trust closures that present an avenue for hijacking resolution."

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) offers simplicity and robustness, while Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) yields state-of-the-art results but suffers from instability and reward hacking. We propose Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback (SuperHF), a method combining the best of both approaches. SuperHF focuses on the reward model's importance in RLHF for data efficiency and generalization while replacing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a simpler supervised loss and a KL divergence prior.

We split our evaluation criteria into robust optimization of the reward while also avoiding reward hacking. For the former, SuperHF beats other training methods on the reward objective. For the latter, we conduct qualitative ratings by GPT-4 to find SuperHF outperforms RLHF in terms of reward, stability, robustness across hyperparameters, and reducing reward hacking."

We explore using active learning to address this need, adapting modern active learning approaches to the structure of remote sensing data. First, we improve upon ”cold-start” active learning, which assumes no initial label pool, by using SatMAE, a self-supervised vision transformer, with ProbCover, a state-of-the-art active learning algorithm. Next, we improve on ”warm-start” active learning approaches, which require an initial label pool, by incorporating geographical information with the margin and entropy sampling techniques. We showcase strong results for each domain, demonstrating the use case of active learning in this space. "

Our game supports up to four players and consists of three rounds. During each round, you will plot everyone (including yourself!) on a cartesian plane using a variety of wacky prompts to guide your placements. You can feel free to answer honestly as there are no winners or losers in this game, only data! Once all players’ placements are collected, you will get to see each player’s average placement, as well as where everyone individually placed them. After the three rounds, special titles are awarded based on each player's results and how their responses compare to the others’!"
